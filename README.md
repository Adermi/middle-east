# Middle East

A `RTL` theme for the wonderful [Typora](https://typora.io), inspired by [Bear](https://bear.app)'s colors and elegancy.

![demo](./media/demo.png)

Uses *Vazir* and *Vazir-Bold* fonts, & the colors are based on Bear's *Red Graphite* and *Dark Graphite* themes.

Code fence themes are adapted from CodeMirror's *3024 Day* and *Dracula* themes for Ursine Polar and Umbra, respectively.

> Note: These themes have been designed and tested on **MacOS** and *partially on Windows*. They have not been fully tested, but they should theoretically work fine for Windows and Linux.

> *Now with unibody styling!*
